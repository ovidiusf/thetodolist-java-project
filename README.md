Project:
> Created with IntelliJ and SceneBuilder
> Database is MySQL created with MySQL Workbench and MySQL Server
> Dependencies are currently managed by Maven
> Used JDBC to link the DB with the UI

Future plans: to export the app as a stand-alone together with the JRE and a connection to a remote DB
Current problems: exporting the app as stand-alone, Jlink does not work with automodules (the JDBC driver)
